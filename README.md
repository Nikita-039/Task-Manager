This Task Manager App is a full-stack web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. 
It allows users to add, update, and mark tasks as completed, providing a streamlined dashboard for task tracking. 
The application features user authentication, task categorization, and a responsive UI for seamless accessibility.
The frontend is built using React.js with Bootstrap for styling, while the backend is powered by Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for data storage. 
Axios is used for API calls, and React Router handles navigation. The app also includes authentication using JWT stored in localStorage for session management. 
The project is designed to be deployed on Vercel for the frontend and Render for the backend, ensuring scalability and ease of hosting.
